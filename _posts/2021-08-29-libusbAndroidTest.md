 Example of an Android app for testing libusb with Java and C++.
 
# Why
Support for libusb in non rooted Android devices is still not properly solved [ref](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/pull/874), this repository tries combines the code from various repositories (references below) to generate an Android app to connect to usb devices combining Java and Native c++ code.

Compared to [my other repository wiht only native Android code](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/libusbNativeAndroidTest) that used a version of libusb that is still not final, this repository uses the official libusb library version.

# Usage
The modified libusb library is added as a submodule, so you will have to load the submodule either by clonning with the recursive flag or:

```
git clone https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/libusbAndroidTest.git
cd libusbAndroidTest
git submodule update --init
```

# Output
The name of the connected device will appear on the screem. Extra information of the device is displayed in the logcat, you can check it by filtering for text contanining the **LOG_TAG** string (defined in libusb_utils.h and set to *libusbNativeAndroidTest* by default).
